# Student Scores Linear Regression Project

## Overview
This project implements a linear regression analysis to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied. The analysis is performed using Python and various data science libraries. The goal is to understand the relationship between study hours and scores, visualize the data, and evaluate the performance of the regression model.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd student_scores_linear_regression
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the analysis, open the `student_scores.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code). Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data, visualize it, train the linear regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Additional Information
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different datasets or regression techniques. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
